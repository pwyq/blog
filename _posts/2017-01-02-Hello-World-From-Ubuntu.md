## Happy New Year!

<p>(lol, please forgive my naive writing style)</p>

<p>New year, new style. ^_^ Today, I attempted to install a new Operating System , a cute member from the big family of Linux, the Ubuntu Linux! Yeah~! I admit there are other awesome Linux editions out there, such as the Arch Linux and LFS. lol, however, those are not that suitable for a total newbee on Linux System. So I chose to start with the easist guy, U~bun~tuuu~~. </p>

<p>At the very beginning, I thought it might be very difficult for me to tackle all this. After all, I have used the Windows OS since I first touched computers; from Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1 to the newest Windows 10. It indeed quite a challenge to step out of my comfort zone; however, it turns out it's not that hard to set down all the configurations. </p>

<p>I first copied all important files to my USB, since I merely want a clean Ubuntu without Windows as a second OS on my lovely X1-C. I then downloaded the latest version of Ubuntu 16.04, and burn it to my USB so that I could use the USB as a boot device. The most discouraged part is to enter the BIOS and set up the correct reboot options. I wasted almost 1 and half hours on this. "Restart. Ugh! Not Working! Restart! Please work! UGHHH! NOT Working!" Actually, it does not need to reboot that way; the time I succeed was to enter the Setting->Restart from USB HDD. That's all!</p>

<p>After entering the Ubuntu Desktop, I installed some essential software for developing and daily uses. I have to say that doing all that configurations on the Terminal console is really geek! Love it! Finally, I got the git back on my Ubuntu, yeah~!</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the start of my 1B term. Only two lectures though. lol. Hope to know more interesting people this term~~</p>

	work hard, play hard~
	so com' along with us~ ...
