Well, if this one success, I may really cry out. 
I mean, the previous ones I built are neithly only with the .github.io working nor only have the post function.
Today and yesterday I've commit more than a hundred times and re-create the github page for idk-how-many-times.
All I want at the beginning was, <strong>just</strong> a place created by my own to post some articles I like; however,
<del>yeah, may be I am too dumb to code</del>, <strong>I still got here</strong> : ) with some fresh HTML and git knowledge.
