Well, if this one success, I may really cry out. 
I mean, the previous ones I built were either only with the .github.io working or only have the post function.<br>
Today and yesterday I've commited more than a hundred times and re-created the github page for idk-how-many-times.<br>
All I want at the beginning was, <strong>just</strong> a place created by my own to post some articles I like; however, those attempts just didn't work :( <del>yeah, may be I am too dumb to deal with github</del>, <strong>I still got here</strong> : ) with some newly learnt HTML and git knowledge.<br>

<p>update: It's worked! Gosh! Credit to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Hank Quinlan</a>. Thank you so much!
Many thanks to other guiders for creating your tutorials on github pages as well. I may not fully success on creating this site following your tutorials, but I also learnt a lot! That's also a kind of success, isn't it?</p>
