<p>Well, if this one success, I may really cry out. <p>
I mean, the previous ones I built were either only with the .github.io working or only have the post function.<br>
Today and yesterday I've commited more than a hundred times and re-created the github page for idk-how-many-times.<br>
All I want at the beginning was, <strong>just</strong> a place created by my own to post some articles I like; however, those attempts just didn't work :( <del>yeah, may be I am too dumb to deal with github</del>, <strong>but I still got here</strong> : ) with some newly learnt HTML and git knowledge!<br></p>

<p>update: It's worked! Gosh! Credit to <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">Hank Quinlan</a>. Thank you so much!
Many thanks to other guiders for creating your tutorials on the topics of `github pages` as well. Although I didn't create the site successfully with your tutorials, I also learnt a lot! That's another kind of success, isn't it?</p>

<b>An update after 427 days! (Feb 18th, 2018)</b>:
<br />
Today I was going to deprecate some old github repositories, I found following:

<img src="/assets/images/posts/First-Post/wth.png" alt="What???" align="center">
<p style="font-size: 16px" align="center">
    <b> (((　ﾟдﾟ))) What? <i>"Your site is published at..."</i> WHAT???</b><br />
    I mean, I didn't touch that repo for more than a year! How it is being online? WHATTT?
    I bought current domain name on August, 2017, which is 8 months later after that repo.
    How is it possible it is being auto online?? The `gh-pages`?

Anyway, this is amazing! Just like finding an Easter egg!
