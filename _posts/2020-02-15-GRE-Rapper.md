I have determined to take GRE in two months.
For the last week, I have been learning new GRE words as it is my full-time job (Well, way more than full-time).
Moreover, I have stumbled upon a number of words that have similar postfix and word structure.

Besides the GRE glossaries, I have been listening to Eminem's songs while I do quotidian running (Amazing performce on the Oscar, by the way).
All these ingredients are combined together to produce my very first rap:

```
** GRE-RAPPER ** by PWYQ

Hey, y' know, preparing the test makes me a RAPPER who wears goggle
Com' on, stop shuffle and hobble, join me and settle.
Let's gabble and babble.

First make some doodles and have some noodle. (Then hide the nipples)
Don't boggle anymore. Others will giggle.
You don't wanna dillydally all day long, yo,
I mean stay away from piddle, diddle or dawdle.
Those gonna enfeeble you.

Quit gobble, stop guttle, drop your guzzle.
You've dabbled in so many areas in undergrad,
Now you got to peddle yourself to the goddamn postgrad.
Stop coddle me, meddle me, nettle me; please mettle me.
Shh, muffle. Now go back to study.
Wait, work harder, so I can see your dimple.
```

I portend/forecast/foreshadow/foreknowledge/forebode/anticipate/foresee/prefigure/predict/bode/betoken/adumbrate/presage/prognosticate you probably do not recognize all the words in the above rap. I therefore prepare the explanation to those GRE words.
