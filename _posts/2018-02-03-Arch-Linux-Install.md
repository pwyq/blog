# Under Construction

I blew my Ubuntu OS three days ago. 
Long story short, I stuck in an infinite login loop, and I couldn't find a workaround to address the problem. 
Well, since I need to re-install my system anyway, why not try something new.
Yet, it's still took me quite long time to configure everything in Arch.
