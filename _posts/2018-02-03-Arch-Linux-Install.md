## Under Construction

I blew my Ubuntu OS three days ago.   
Long story short, I stuck in an infinite login loop, and I couldn't find a workaround to address the problem (with 2-hour intensive googling). 
Well, since I need to re-install my system anyway, why not try something new.
Though I've spent more than one year on Ubuntu Linux (daily use and at work), it's still took me two nights to configure everything in Arch.

> I would definitely NOT recommend a total newbit to Linux to try *Arch Linux*. IT'S TOO "LIGHT"!

## Installation & Configuration
Since there are plenty of decent and mature online tutorials, it would be pointless for me to reinvent the wheel.
I will recommend some of them below that I followed with.  
**Notes**:  
> 1. Make sure you understand how each command works (use `man <cmd>` or `<cmd> --help` to display commands' descriptions)
> 2. *Always* refer to [Arch Wiki][6] first when you are confused
