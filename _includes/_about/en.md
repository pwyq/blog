#### Others
You may notice that some posts are written in strange languages; relax, that's (mostly) Chinese.
When I write non-technical stuff, I use my mother tongue as it's the best way to present my feelings.

In addition, if you find some incorrect use of words (or simply feel weird), it will be very kind of you if you can let me know :) 
Thanks in advance!
