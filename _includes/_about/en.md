#### About The Site

- [My Principles for Posting][post_rule]{:target="_blank"}
- About Site Name  
    Well, `PWYQ` is the ID I used most frequently (for now) in online communities, `Space` is because I purely love outer space.
    `P` was the initial of my English name that I used for 10+ years, but I decided to stop using it since 2017 summer
    (Why? I will write a post to explain, hopefully).
    `WYQ` is the initial of my Chinese name in Chinese order (￣∇￣).
- About Post Language  
    You may notice that some posts are written in strange languages; relax, that's (mostly) simplified Chinese.
    When I write non-technical stuff, I use my mother tongue as it's the best way to convey my feelings.
    
    In addition, if you find any incorrect use of word/punctuation (or simply feel weird), it will be very kind of you to inform me (I'm learning English~) ^_^
