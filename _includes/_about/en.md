#### About Site Name
Well, `PWYQ` is the ID I used most frequently in online communities, `Space` is because I purely love outer space.
`P` was the initial of my English name that I used for 10+ years, but I decided to stop using it since 2017 summer
(Why? I will write a post to explain, hopefully).
`WYQ` is the initial of my Chinese name in Chinese order XD.

#### About Post Language
You may notice that some posts are written in strange languages; relax, that's (mostly) simplified Chinese.
When I write non-technical stuff, I use my mother tongue as it's the best way to convey my feelings.

In addition, if you find some incorrect use of words (or simply feel weird), it will be very kind of you if you can let me know :) 

Thank you again for visiting my site!
